üí∞ Currency Converter
Welcome to the Currency Converter! This is a clean, modern web application that provides real-time exchange rates for over 150 currencies. Built with simplicity and usability in mind, it allows you to quickly convert amounts between any two currencies with a single click.

‚ú® Features
Live Exchange Rates: Fetches the most up-to-date currency data from a reliable API to ensure accuracy.

Intuitive Interface: A simple, single-page layout that makes currency conversion a breeze.

Dynamic Flag Updates: The flag icon changes automatically as you select a new currency, providing a satisfying visual cue.

Error Handling: Gracefully handles network issues or API failures, so you'll know exactly what's going on if something goes wrong.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
This application is a perfect example of a front-end project that interacts with an external service. It's built with three core technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure of the webpage.

CSS: Gives the app its unique style and modern look.

JavaScript: The "brain" of the application. It handles all the logic:

It fetches the currency data from the currency-api.

It listens for user actions, like changing a dropdown or clicking the "Convert" button.

It updates the flag images and displays the final converted amount.
